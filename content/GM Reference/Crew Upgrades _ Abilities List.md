# Standard Upgrades
###### Boat house: 
You have a boat, a dock on a waterway, and a small shack to store boating supplies. A second upgrade improves the boat with armor and more cargo capacity.
###### Carriage House: 
You have a carriage, two goats to pull it, and a stable. A second upgrade improves the carriage with armor and larger, swifter goats. *Horses are very rare in Doskvol—most carriages in the city use the large [[Akorosian Goats]] as their draft animal.*
###### Cohort: 
A cohort is a gang or a single expert NPC who works for your crew. To recruit a new cohort, spend two upgrades and create them using the process described [[Cohorts|here]].
###### Hidden Lair: 
Your lair has a secret location and is disguised to hide it from view. If your lair is discovered, use two downtime activities and pay coin equal to your Tier to relocate it and hide it once again.
###### Mastery: 
Your crew has access to master level training. You may advance your PCs’ action ratings to 4 (*until you unlock this upgrade, PC action ratings are capped at 3*). This costs four upgrade boxes to unlock.
###### Quality: 
Each upgrade improves the quality rating of all the PCs’ items of that type, beyond the quality established by the crew’s Tier and fine items. You can improve the quality of Documents, Gear (covers Burglary Gear and Climbing Gear), Arcane Implements, Subterfuge Supplies, Tools (covers Demolitions Tools and Tinkering Tools), and Weapons.
###### Quarters: 
Your lair includes living quarters for the crew. Without this upgrade, each PC sleeps elsewhere, and is vulnerable when they do so.
###### Secure Lair: 
Your lair has locks, alarms, and traps to thwart intruders. A second upgrade improves the defences to include arcane measures that work against spirits. You might roll your crew’s Tier if these measures are ever put to the test, to see how well they thwart an intruder.
###### Training: 
If you have a Training upgrade, you earn 2 xp (instead of 1) when you train a given xp track during Downtime (Insight, Prowess, Resolve, or Playbook
xp). This upgrade essentially helps you advance more quickly. 
###### Vault: 
Your lair has a secure vault, increasing your storage capacity for coin to 8. A second upgrade increases your capacity to 16. A separate part of your vault can be used as a holding cell.
###### Workshop: 
Your lair has a workshop appointed with tools for tinkering and alchemy, as well as a small library of books, documents, and maps. You may accomplish
long-term projects with these assets without leaving your lair.

the notice of the [[Deathseeker Crows]]. You don’t take extra heat when killing is
involved on a score.
*The bells don’t ring at the crematorium when a member of your crew kills
someone. Do you have a “membership ritual” now that conveys this talent?*
###### Emberdeath
Due to hard-won experience or occult ritual, you know the arcane method to
destroy a living victim’s spirit at the moment you kill them. Take *3 Stress* to
channel electroplasmic energy from the [[Ghost Field]] to disintegrate the spirit and body in a shower of sparking embers.

When you keep an operation quiet or make it look like an accident, you get half
the Rep value of the target (round up) instead of zero. When you end Downtime

you employ a poison, you are specially prepared to be immune to its effects.

If you have the Elite Thugs upgrade, it stacks with this ability. This ability may result in a gang with three types, surpassing the normal limit
of two.

*The maximum wanted level is 4. Regardless of how much turf you hold
(from this ability or otherwise) the minimum rep cost to advance your Tier
is always 6.*
###### Forged in Fire
Each PC has been toughened by cruel experience. You get +1d to resistance rolls. This ability applies to PCs in the crew. It doesn’t confer any special toughness to your cohorts.
###### Patron 
When you advance your Tier, it costs half the coin it normally would.
*Who is your patron? Why do they help you?*

###### Bound in Darkness
You may use teamwork manoeuvres with any cult member, regardless of the
distance separating you. By taking 1 Stress, your whispered message is heard
by every cultist.
*By what occult means does your teamwork manifest over distance? How is it
strange or disturbing? By what ritualistic method are cult members initiated
into this ability?*
###### Conviction
Each PC gains an additional vice: Worship. *When you indulge this vice and
bring a pleasing sacrifice, you don’t overindulge if you clear excess stress.* In
addition, your deity will assist any one action roll you make—from now until
you indulge this vice again.
*What sort of sacrifice does your deity find pleasing?*
###### Glory Incarnate
Your deity sometimes manifests in the physical world. This can be a great boon, but the priorities and values of a god are not those of mortals. *You have been warned.*
###### Sealed in Blood
Each human sacrifice yields -3 stress cost for any ritual you perform.
See here for details on [[Rituals]].
###### Zealotry
Your cohorts have abandoned their reason to devote themselves to the cult. They will undertake any service, no matter how dangerous or strange. They gain +1d to rolls when they act against enemies of the faith.

When you deal with a crew or faction, the GM will tell you who among them is
hooked on your product (one, a few, many, or all).
###### High Society
It’s all about who you know. Take -1 heat during Downtime and +1d to gather
information about the city’s elite.

and interact with the ghostly structures, streets, and objects within the echo of
Doskvol that exists in the ghost field.
*You might explore the echo of an ancient building, crumbled to dust in the
real world, but still present in the ghost field; or discern the electroplasmic
glow of treasures lost in the depths of the canals; or use a sorcerous ghost door
from the pre-cataclysm to infiltrate an otherwise secure location; etc. The GM
will tell you what echoes persist nearby when you gather information about
them. You might also undertake investigations to discover particular echoes
you hope to find.*
###### Pack Rats
