# Standard Items
###### A Blade or Two: 
Perhaps you carry a simple fighting knife. Or two curved
swords. Or a rapier and stiletto. Or a heavy butcher’s cleaver. Your choice might reflect your heritage 
- In the North([[Akoros]] and [[Skovlan]]) blades tend to be broad, heavy, and single-edged.
- In [[Severos]], the horse-lords favour spears in battle, but for personal combat they carry distinctive double-edged daggers with very wide blades, often intricately inscribed with family histories.
- In the [[Dagger Isles]], the corsairs often use narrow, light blades made for quick thrusts—such as the rapier and stiletto. 
- In [[Iruvia]], curved blades are common; sharpened on the outer edge like a sabre, or sharpened on the inner edge, like a sickle.
