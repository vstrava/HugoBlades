When you recover, you seek treatment and heal your harm. You might visit a
physicker who can stitch your wounds and soothe your mind with anatomical
science or a witch who specializes in healing charms and restorative alchemy. If you don’t have a contact or fellow PC who can provide treatment, you can use the acquire asset activity to gain access to a healer, who can provide service for the whole crew.

Recovery is like a [[Long-Term Project]]. Your healer rolls (Tinker for a PC with
the Physicker special ability or the quality level of an NPC) and then you
mark a number of segments on your healing clock: 
- **1-3:** one segment  
- **4/5:** two segments 
- **6:** three segments 
- **Critical:** five segments

When you fill your healing clock, reduce each instance of harm on your sheet by one level, then clear the clock. If you have more segments to mark, they “roll over.”
