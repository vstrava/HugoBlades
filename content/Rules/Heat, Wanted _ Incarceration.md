## Heat
After a score or conflict with an opponent, your crew takes heat according to the nature of the operation:
- **0 Heat:** Smooth and quiet; low exposure
- **2 Heat:** Contained; standard exposure
- **4 Heat:** Loud & chaotic; high exposure
- **6 Heat:** Wild; devastating exposure
- ***Add +1 Heat*** for high-profile or well connected target
- ***Add +1 Heat*** if the situation happened on hostile Turf
- ***Add +1 Heat*** if you're at war with another faction
- ***Add +2 Heat*** if killing was involved (whether the crew did the killing
or not—bodies draw attention). 

***When your Heat level reaches 9***, you gain a **Wanted Level** and clear your Heat (any excess Heat "rolls over"). The higher your Wanted Level, the more serious the response when law enforcement takes action against you (they'll send a force of higher *quality* and *scale*). Also, your Wanted Level contributes to the severity of the Entanglements that your crew faces after a score.

## Incarceration 
The only way to reduce your crew’s Wanted Level is through incarceration.
*When one of your crew members, friends, contacts—or a framed enemy—is
convicted and incarcerated for crimes associated with your crew, your wanted
level is reduced by 1 and you clear your heat.*

The severity of the prison sentence depends on your wanted level:
- **Wanted Level 4:** Life or execution.
* **Wanted Level 3:** A year or two.
- **Wanted Level 2:** Several months.
- **Wanted Level 1:** A month or two.
- **Wanted Level 0:** A few weeks. Or, the Bluecoats give you a beating
to teach you a lesson (suffer level 3 harm, no resistance roll allowed—
they keep going until you’re injured).

Incarceration is dehumanizing and brutal. The renown of your crew is your only real defence inside. When you serve your time, make an incarceration roll using your crew’s Tier as the dice pool.  ^fcd080
- **Critical:** You make a name for yourself inside. You gain +3 Rep for your crew, 1 Prison Claim and +1 Faction Status with a faction that you assisted while you served your time. 
- **6:** You do your time well. Your crew gains 1 Prison Claim and +1 Faction Status with a faction that you assisted while you served your time. 
- **4/5:** You keep your head down and do your time without incident. 
- **1-3:** It's horrific. You suffer a level of Trauma from the experience.
