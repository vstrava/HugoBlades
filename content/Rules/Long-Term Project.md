When you work on a long-term project (either a brand new one, or an already
existing one), describe what your character does to advance the project clock, and roll one of your actions. Mark segments on the clock according to your result:
- **1-3:** one segment  
- **4/5:** two segments 
- **6:** three segments 
- **Critical:** five segments

Based on the goal of the project, the GM will tell you the clock(s) to create and
suggest a method by which you might make progress.
