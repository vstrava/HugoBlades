A cohort is a gang or an expert who works for your crew. To recruit a new cohort, spend *two upgrades* and create them using the process below.
#### Creating a Gang
Choose a gang type from the list below:
- **Adepts**
	- Scholars, tinkerers, occultists, and chemists
- **Rooks** 
	- Con artists, spies, and socialites
- **Rovers**
	- Sailors, carriage drivers, and [[Deathlands]] scavengers
- **Skulks**
	- Scouts, infiltrators, and thieves
- **Thugs** 
	- Killers, brawlers, and roustabouts
A gang has scale and quality equal to your current crew Tier. It increases in scale and quality when your crew moves up in Tier.
Some crew upgrades will add the “Elite” feature to a gang, which gives them +1d when they roll for a given Type. So, if you’re Tier I and have a gang of Elite Thugs (+1d), they would roll 2d when they try to kill a target.
#### Creating an Expert
Record the expert’s type (their specific area of expertise). They might be a Doctor, an Investigator, an Occultist, an Assassin, a Spy, etc.
An expert has quality equal to your current crew Tier +1. Their scale is always
zero (1 person). Your experts increase in quality when your crew moves up in Tier.
#### Edges & Flaws
When you create a cohort, give them one or two edges and an equal number
of flaws.
###### Edges
- **Fearsome:** The cohort is terrifying in aspect and reputation.
- **Independent:** The cohort can be trusted to make good decisions and act on their own initiative in the absence of direct orders.
- **Loyal:** The cohort can’t be bribed or turned against you.
- **Tenacious:** The cohort won’t be deterred from a task.
###### Flaws
- **Principled:** The cohort has an ethic or values that it won’t betray.
- **Savage:** The cohort is excessively violent and cruel.
- **Unreliable:** The cohort isn’t always available, due to other obligations, stupefaction from their vices, etc.
- **Wild:** The cohort is drunken, debauched, and loud-mouthed.
#### Modifying a Cohort
You can add an additional type to a gang or expert by spending two crew upgrades. When a cohort performs actions for which its types apply, it uses its
full quality rating. Otherwise, its quality is zero. A given cohort can have up to
two types.
#### Using a Cohort
When you send a cohort to achieve a goal, roll their quality to see how it goes.
Or, a PC can oversee the manoeuvre by leading a group action. If you direct the
cohort with orders, roll Command. If you participate in the action alongside
the cohort, roll the appropriate action. The quality of any opposition relative to
the cohort’s quality affects the position and effect of the action.
## Cohort Harm & Healing
Cohorts suffer harm similarly to PCs. A cohort can suffer four levels of harm:
1. **Weakened**. The cohort has reduced effect.
2. **Impaired**. The cohort operates with reduced quality (-1d).
3. **Broken**. The cohort can’t do anything until they recover.
4. *Dead*. The cohort is destroyed.
All of your cohorts heal during downtime. If circumstances are amenable for
recovery, each cohort removes one level of harm (or two levels of harm instead,
if a PC spends a downtime activity helping them recuperate).
If a cohort is destroyed, it may be replaced. Spend coin equal to your Tier +2
to restore it, plus two downtime activities to recruit new gang members, or hire
a new expert.
