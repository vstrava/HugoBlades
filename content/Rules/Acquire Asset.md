Gain temporary use of an asset:
- One special item or set of common items (enough for a gang of your Tier scale).
- A cohort (an expert or gang).
- A vehicle.
- A service. Transport from a smuggler or driver, use of a warehouse for
temporary storage, legal representation, etc.

“Temporary use” constitutes one significant period of usage that makes sense for the asset—typically the duration of one score. An asset may also be acquired for “standby” use in the future. You might hire a gang to guard your lair, for example, and they’ll stick around until after the first serious battle, or until a week goes by and they lose interest.

***To acquire the asset,*** roll the crew’s Tier. The result indicates the quality of the asset you get, using the crew’s Tier as the base: 
- **1-3:** Tier -1 
- **4/5:** Tier 
- **6:** Tier +1 
- **Critical:** Tier +2  

You can spend Coin to raise the result of this roll beyond critical by spending 2 coin per additional Tier level added.

The GM may set a minimum quality level that must be achieved to acquire a
particular asset. 

If you acquire the same asset again, you get +1d to your roll. If you continue to
re-acquire an asset every time it’s used, you can effectively rent it indefinitely.

Alchemicals, poisons, bombs, and dangerous gadgets are highly restricted in
Doskvol. *When you acquire one of these items, you take +2 heat.* 

If you want to acquire an asset permanently, you can either gain it as a crew
upgrade or work on it as a long-term project to set up a permanent acquisition.
