*Visit your **Vice Purveyor*** to relieve stress.

When you indulge your vice, say how your character indulges their vice, including which purveyor of vice they use to satisfy their needs. 

This indulgence takes time, so it can only be done when the crew has [[Downtime Checklist|Downtime]]. *Alternately, you may choose to release your character to be “lost in their vice” during a game session, allowing them to indulge off-camera while you play a different PC.* 

A vice roll is like a resistance roll in reverse—rather than gaining stress levels, you clear stress levels. *The effectiveness of your indulgence depends upon your character’s worst **attribute rating**.* Make an attribute roll using your character’s lowest attribute rating (if there’s a tie, that’s fine—simply use that rating). Clear stress equal to the highest die result.
#### Overindulgence
If your vice roll clears more stress levels than you had marked, you **overindulge***.

When you overindulge, you make a bad call because of your vice—in acquiring
it or while under its influence. Select an overindulgence from the list:
- **Attract Trouble:** Select or roll an additional entanglement.
- **Brag about your exploits:** +2 heat.
- **Lost:** Your character vanishes for a few weeks. Play a different character until this one returns from their bender. When your character returns, they’ve also healed any harm they had.
- **Tapped:** Your current purveyor cuts you off. Find a new source for your vice.
