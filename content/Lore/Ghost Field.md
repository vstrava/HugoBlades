Every living thing in the [[Shattered Isles]] has evolved a sensitivity to the invisible “other world” that presses always against the edges of perception—the strange dimension that erupted during the [[Cataclysm]], known as the ghost field.

By focusing their mind in a certain way, a human can attune to the ghost field to perceive partially into it, to sense the echoes of real-world events captured in the field, or to make a connection to ghosts and spectral energy. 

Some people see attunement as a normal part of life—a new human sense that is natural and advantageous. Others see attunement as a vile act, connecting with the dark forces that once destroyed the world, and who still lurk in the shadows, always ready to prey upon the unwary or power-hungry.

One thing is certain, the broken world will never be made whole again. The black void of the skies and seas, the psychic pressure of the ghost field, and the machinations of demons and cultists are now the way of things. Better to understand these strange forces than to be consumed by them.

The “ghost field” is somewhat ambiguous, by design. It’s the energy contained within the lightning barrier of the city, the echoes of events in the recent past, and the medium in which spirits exist. It’s a dangerous and strange element that should never feel safe or tame. To Attune is to connect to a crackling source of power that can easily snap out of control. Bring your ideas of strange arcane energy into play and ask the other players what they think about it, too.

When you Attune to the ghost field you can see echoes of recent events or sense things beyond sight (the Whisper’s fine spirit mask allows them to see even more detail). Surveying is usually the action you’d use to get a sense of a location or to spot hidden things, but Attuning can work— Often with a worse position since you’re risking danger from the ghost field.
