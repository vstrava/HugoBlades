*Coalridge is home to most of the machinists, industrial laborers, and factories of the city. It’s cramped, soot-choked, and loud—spewing dense clouds of black smoke, showers of sparks, and burning cinders. The old elevated train lines that once hauled coal now carry heavy equipment and raw materials to and from [[Gaddoc Station]], though many of the ancient tracks and cars have been abandoned to squatters who’ve converted them into makeshift homes.*
