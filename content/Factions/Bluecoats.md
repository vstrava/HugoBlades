# Quirks
- divided into companies by district
	- some precincts better resourced than others (difference in Tier)
- fierce rivalries between companies (often good natured - sometimes violent) actively encouraged by superior officers
# Clocks
- Procure bigger budget, military arms & equipment (0/8)
# Situation
The Bluecoats have become jealous of the elite hardware and vehicles used by the Imperial Military. They want to refit their watch-guards in heavy armour and weapons, to better strike fear into those they prey upon.
