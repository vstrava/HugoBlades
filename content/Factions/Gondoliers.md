# Situation
Killers have disposed of bodies in the canals of [[Doskvol]] for centuries. The vengeful ghosts that rise from the corpses are a serious threat—a threat dealt with by the Gondoliers since ancient times. 

Before the [[Spirit Wardens]] were created by the Emperor, the Gondoliers protected citizens from rogue spirits and supernatural dangers of all kinds. The Gondoliers are beloved by most citizens, who prefer to go to them with “weird problems” rather that relying on the ruthless and indiscriminate judgment of the Spirit Wardens. 

A sudden influx of ritually disfigured hollows dumped in the canals has sparked investigation by the Gondoliers (the Spirit Wardens are pointedly ignoring the situation).
