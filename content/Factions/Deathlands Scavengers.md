# Situation
Condemned prisoners are sometimes given “mercy” and sent into the Deathlands rather than being executed at Ironhook. A few survive, thanks to Lady Thorn and her Deathlands Scavengers, who take them in and train them in the ways of Deathlands hunting and survival. The scavengers hunt for lost artifacts and treasures in the wastes, to sell or trade in the city, sometimes for enough to buy a pardon and return to life within the barriers once again.
