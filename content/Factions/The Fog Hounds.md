- Old North Port supply caches.
# Assets

# Quirks
- As veterans of many cruises on the Void Sea, Vale and her crew can be insular and clannish, and have a low initial opinion of anyone who hasn’t proven themselves in a similar way. Once won, however, their loyalty is rock solid and fierce.
# Clocks
- Eliminate rival smugglers (0/8)
- Obtain regular patron (0/6)
# Situation
Vale and her crew have mastered the Northern smuggling routes in and out of Duskwall. They’re currently attempting to absorb or eliminate the few remaining rivals on their territory and then establish reliable, regular work with a patron who needs a steady stream of contraband.
