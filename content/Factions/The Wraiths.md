# Situation
The Wraiths recently completed a heist at a luxury brothel in Nightmarket and happened to grab the private map book of a [[Leviathan Hunters|Leviathan Hunter]] in the process. The map book shows the secret hunting grounds of augured leviathan sites that will be used by the ship *Storm Palace* during the next season. Such a map is useless to the Wraiths, but is worth a small fortune to another leviathan hunter. The Wraiths are currently reaching out to contacts in the underworld to quietly arrange a sale.
