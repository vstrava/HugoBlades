# Quirks
- Zealous believers volunteer to be hollowed to “become purified.” This was once common among the ancient cult of the [[Empty Vessel]], a cult which preceded the modern Church.

# Situation
The purest beings (according to the teachings of the Church) are those entirely without spirits: the [[Demons]]. Demons are immortal, but never fade into madness or lustful hungers as rogue human spirits and [[Vampires]] do. They are perfect; and the most devout of the Church seek to become as they are, to unlock the secret of ascension. Many dark experiments and rituals with [[Hull]]s, [[Hollow]]s, vampires - and the rare demon - are conducted in the labyrinthine dungeons below the Church's chief cathedral in Brightstone.
