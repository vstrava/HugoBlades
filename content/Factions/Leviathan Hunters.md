# Situation
The captains have a horrible secret: the known hunting grounds for leviathans are coming up barren. The immortal creatures, once so reliable in their movements in the Void Sea, have begun to migrate elsewhere. New hunting grounds must be found before the surplus of leviathan blood disappears, and with it, the lightning barriers and the survival of the human race.
