# Quirks

- some are also secretly initiates in the [[Path of Echoes]]
# Clocks
- Remove Strangford from the Council (0/6)
- Strangford eliminates threats (0/8)
# Situation
Three of the councillors (Bowmore, Clelland, Rowan) have aligned against Strangford and are manoeuvring to remove the house from the council. Dunvil and Penderyn have not taken sides so far. 
Can the conspirators arrange for the necessary scandal, framed crime, or assassinations to remove Strangford? 
Or can Strangford House stand against them and eliminate the threats?
