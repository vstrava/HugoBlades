# Situation
The Circle has an extensive library of scholarly works that catalogue many of the arcane artifacts and valuable treasures that disappeared when the [[Lost District]] was abandoned outside the [[Lightning Towers|Lightning Barrier]]. Of special interest are the remains of [[Kotar]], a legendary sorcerer, demon, or hero who was mummified before the cataclysm. The [[Eye of Kotar|Eye]], [[Hand of Kotar|Hand]], and [[Heart of Kotar|Heart]] of Kotar are said to possess great power for those bold enough to risk their use.
